-- Unspecified dispatch mode now means NEXT_ON_ERROR, not IMMEDIATE.
--
-- IMMEDIATE is the only mode with no ordering at all, so an omitted mode
-- silently discarded sequencing — and only visibly under load, where concurrent
-- dispatch actually interleaves. Ordering is cheap to opt out of and expensive
-- to discover you never had, so the default now keeps a message group in
-- sequence and moves on past a failure.
--
-- Column defaults only. Rows that already say IMMEDIATE keep saying it: this
-- changes what "unspecified" means from here on, not anyone's stored choice.
-- (Ungrouped traffic is unaffected in practice — the router dispatches a
-- message with no message group concurrently whatever its mode, because
-- ordering is only defined relative to a group.)

-- Only the two tables where "unspecified" is a real input path.
-- msg_dispatch_jobs_read is a projection whose writer always supplies the mode,
-- so it is left without one rather than given a default it can never use.
